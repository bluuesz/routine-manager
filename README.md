<h2>Why?</h2>
Maybe I have ADHD and it hurts me a lot when organizing my day to day. And yes, I know you already have apps to do this, but I want my own as well as being a great opportunity to learn new technologies.


<h2>Built With</h2>

* [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) - A framework for building native apps using React
* [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/) - styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - A runtime javascript
* [TypeScript](https://rometools.github.io/rome/) - Is a static type-checking along with the latest ECMAScript features.
* [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/) - Is an ORM that can run in NodeJS
* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) -  A query language for your API
* [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) - Provide the data graph layer that connects modern apps to the cloud.
